# Hands on Lab Overview

The instructions in this Hands on Lab can be used in many scenarios.  Drone imagery can be used to identify homes, buildings, neighborhoods, landscape, agricultural farms, and industrial sites.

Several examples of these drone image instructions are included :

* [Wild Fires](/WildFires/WILDFIRES.md) - Survey wildfire damaged neighborhoods and identify burned homes and intact homes.
* [Scotland](/Scotland/SCOTLAND.md) - Survey Scottish countryside and identify Castles and traditional earthen / grass covered Black Houses.
* [Flooding](/Flooding/FLOODING.md) - Survey flooded neighborhoods and detect survivors on rooftops.
