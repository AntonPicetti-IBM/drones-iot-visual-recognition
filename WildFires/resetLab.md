Once a participant has finished a lab it’s important that we reset some things in the account in order for the lab to work smoothly for the next participant. Below is a list of things that need to be fixed after each lab. Please update the list or share your suggestions if something is missing.

- Navigate to the projects overview in Watson Studio and delete the project that was last created. Important: don’t delete the project with the name ’Wildfire Burned Homes (pre-trained)’. It’s used in the lab by those who don’t have time to train their own model.
- Make sure that the all three zip-files are available locally on the lab workstation together with the images used for testing the model.
- Leave the home page in Watson Studio open for the next participant.
